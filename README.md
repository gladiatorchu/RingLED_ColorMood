# RingLED_ColorMood
Using Adafruit 16-LED NeoPixel Ring to make a color mood lighting ring

This is a simple project in order to illustrate how to develop the algorithm in PC and implement the algorithm in Arduino to make the color mood lighting ring.

## PC side simulation:
[**Processing**](https://processing.org/) is used to visualize the algorithm regarding to the color tune simulation. You can download the "Processing" software [here](https://processing.org/download/).

## Implmenting the algorithm in arduino:
Using Arduino mini pro or nano or any others is good for the project. Here uses mini pro 3.3V version.
